                <h3>Introduction To Task Flow</h3>
                <p> In today's fast-paced world, juggling multiple projects, deadlines, and responsibilities can feel
                    like a constant uphill battle.  Staying organized and on top of everything is crucial, whether you're
                    managing a team, working on personal goals, or simply trying to keep your daily life in order.
                    That's where TaskFlow comes in.  TaskFlow is a powerful yet intuitive task management application
                    designed to help you streamline your workflow, boost productivity, and achieve your goals with ease.
                    From creating simple to-do lists to managing complex projects, TaskFlow provides the tools you need
                    to stay organized, focused, and in control. Let's explore how TaskFlow can revolutionize the way
                    you manage your tasks.</p>

                <h3>How do you create a task?</h3>
                <p> TaskFlow is simple, yet intuitive. Creating a task is as simple as navigating to the 'create a task'
                    tab located at the top menu. The menu has been designed to never leave your side even as you scroll.
                    This was done on purpose because during a challenging situation, tools and pages need to be within
                    reach and quickly accessible. While fancy menus are visually pleasing, the idea here is to concentrate
                    your cognitive load on the tasks at hand instead of the application itself. Here's some guidance
                    before you take the jump:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate to the 'Create a Task' tab located on the top of the page.</li>
                    <li>Give your task a friendly name.</li>
                    <li>Select the due date using the calendar function.</li>
                    <li>If the task is repeatable, select the days of the week TaskFlow should remind you.</li>
                    <li>If there is a List that the task should be in, select it using the dropdown.</li>
                    <li>That's all! Hit 'Create Task' to save your hard work.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>What is myLists?</h3>
                <p> The 'MyLists' tab is one of the most simple tools to use. Imagine that for the day, there isn't
                    any outstanding tasks at bay. Why not get a head start? 'MyLists' is the simplest method to access
                    categorized tasks that are accumulated as the user is making them using the category drop down.
                    These lists are color coded to maintain integrity and reduce fatigue when trying to find the right
                    task. This feature empowers users to become faster at accessing the tools they need.
